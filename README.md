# pypso

`pypso` is a Python package that provides naive implementations of classic [particle swarm optimization](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Particle_swarm_optimization) algorithms. The purpose of this project is to demonstrate one of the many ways to create a reusable library for scientific computing. This library demonstrates some common development tools and practices for working with Python, including:
- Version control
- Unit tests and code coverage
- Code coverage
- Static typing
- Linting

Other important tools for developing Python packages, such as continuous integration and continuous deployment software, are not discussed here.
